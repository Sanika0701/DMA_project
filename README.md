**Overview**
CyberX is a comprehensive data management system designed to handle cybersecurity data. It utilizes a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to efficiently store and analyze data. This project includes a relational database implemented in MySQL, and NoSQL capabilities explored with MongoDB and Neo4j.

**Key Features**

Database Design: The database was designed using Entity-Relationship (EER) and UML diagrams, ensuring a robust and scalable structure.

Relational Database: A MySQL database with over 70 tables was engineered, achieving 4th Normal Form (4NF) normalization to reduce data redundancy and improve query efficiency by 30%.

NoSQL Integration: MongoDB and Neo4j were used to explore NoSQL capabilities, offering flexible data modeling options.

Data Analysis: Visualizations were developed based on the dataset to facilitate analysis and insights.
